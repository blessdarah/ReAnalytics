# Here's how this section of the code is organized

We create all the directories that reflect the backend of our app.
These directories only show the public areas of our applications.
I'm still looking for a good way to not repeat a lot of code but however, right here, I'm just gonna stick to this for the mean time. I'm sure there will be a better way of customizing the codebase with other different projects. For now, it is going to be a general scenario.

Each directory has the **index** and the **show** pages that are frontend facing to the client. Otherwise, an authenticated user can then follow up with the rest of the pages.
